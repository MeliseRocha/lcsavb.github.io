# Introduction

Welcome to the repository for my personal blog, a platform where I showcase my work and ideas. This blog is part of a project for the General Business and Accounting course at Deggendorf Institute of Technology. My goal is to share insights and experiences from my academic journey and beyond.


## Blog Creation and Automation

To create an efficient and seamless experience, I have employed the following tools:

- **Static Page Generator**: Hugo
  - Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator. It allows for the easy creation of lightweight and fast-loading web pages.
- **GitHub Workflow for Automation**:
  - A custom GitHub workflow is implemented to automate the deployment of the blog. This means that every time I push updates to this repository, the blog is automatically updated.
