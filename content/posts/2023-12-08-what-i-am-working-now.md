Hello, everyone! Today, I want to share with you a project I've been working on for some time, which is very close to my heart - AutoCusto. This project is a solution I developed to tackle a critical challenge in Brazil's public healthcare system.

## Background

In Brazil, we have a universal health system called the Unified Health System (SUS), serving over 190 million people. One of the services the SUS offers are the "High-Cost Pharmacies," which provide specialized medications for chronic diseases. Even with the current minimum wage of R$ 1,320, the costs of these medications can be prohibitive, consuming more than 15% of a person's monthly income.

## Bureaucratic Challenges

The distribution of these medications is accompanied by significant bureaucracy. Doctors must fill out numerous paper forms, and any minor error can lead to the refusal of the medication, causing great inconvenience to patients.

## My Solution: AutoCusto

It was in this context that AutoCusto was born. The name is a play on words in Portuguese, combining "Alto" (High cost) with "Auto" (Automatic). The goal of AutoCusto is to minimize errors, rework, and inconvenience for patients. The primary focus of a doctor should be patient care, not navigating unnecessary bureaucracy.

For the past three years, I have personally used this software with over 400 patients, mainly in neurological disorders. I am excited about the potential of AutoCusto to transform patient care in the Brazilian health system and look forward to continuing to develop and improve this tool.

Stay tuned for project updates and more right here on the blog!
