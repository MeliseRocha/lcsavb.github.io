In their present state, Drug Interaction Checkers often hinder more than they help. This isn't an issue with the concept but rather with their implementation. They've become an obstacle to efficient prescribing, reducing the process to sifting through a barrage of irrelevant warnings, which prompts doctors to often ignore them. This situation underscores an urgent need for innovation in the design and use of these tools.

Take Neurology as a case in point:

- Limited Medication Classes: Neurologists typically use a few classes of medications, such as Neuroleptics, Anticonvulsants, Antidepressants, Dopamine antagonists, Statins, Anticoagulants, and Antiplatelets. The Mechanisms of Action (MoAs) within each class are similar, leading to predictable interactions.

- Leveraging 'Dangerous' Interactions: Sometimes, what is labeled as a dangerous interaction can be beneficial. For example, Valproate increasing Lamotrigine levels is advantageous in treating epilepsy.

- Overlooking Conflicting MoAs: In cases like Parkinson's, conflicting MoAs are often disregarded, requiring both a Dopamine-Antagonist for behavioral control and a dopamine agonist for motor symptoms.

- Challenges in Cross-Checking Prescriptions: Prescriptions from other doctors, especially from different services or not entered into the database, are difficult to cross-reference. This is more common than not.

- Routine Treatment of Common Associated Diseases: Many patients are concurrently treated for prevalent conditions like Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity, and Cardiovascular diseases. The recurring use of the same drug combinations is commonplace.

- Beyond Drug Interactions: Underlying contraindications often go unnoticed. For example, overlooking the need to check for glaucoma when prescribing a tricyclic antidepressant, or neglecting to inquire about a possible pregnancy.

In light of these insights, a future emerges where drug interaction checking becomes a component of a broader system, integrated into the anamnesis and powered by AI. This system wouldnâ€™t merely present queries about a patient's history or interactions; it would also be able to understand the context. Finally, its feedback should be seamlessly integrated, ensuring it is informative yet unobtrusive.
