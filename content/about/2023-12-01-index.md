## About Me

I am a Neurologist, having graduated in 2015 from the Federal University of São Paulo. Currently, as a Health Informatics student at Technische Hochschule Deggendorf, Germany, I integrate my medical expertise with a deep passion for technology.

My journey in the world of programming began in 2019, driven by the need to automate a time-consuming bureaucratic task to focus more on patient care. Since then, I've gained proficiency in Python and Django. In addition to this, I am a seasoned Linux enthusiast, with over 20 years dedicated to this platform, where Arch and Gentoo have been my daily drivers.

Throughout my career, I've observed the dual impact of technology in medicine: its transformative power and its potential pitfalls. While technological advances can improve healthcare, what is deemed 'best practice' in tech doesn't always translate effectively into medical settings. My aim is to bridge this gap, ensuring that technological integration not only enhances healthcare but is also practical and efficient for daily medical workflows.
